# mmWave_RIS_Performance_Optimization

This is the code for our TCOM paper titled ["Millimeter Wave Communications With RIS performance analysis and optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9324795/).

The derived performance expressions, including H-functions, can be computed using *Mathematica".

The code for the Monte Carlo simulation is given in *Matlab*.

The *Python* code provides a high-precision approximation method to calculate the H function [R1].
